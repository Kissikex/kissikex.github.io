# About Me

I am Peter Kiss, a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick. I have started my PhD in 2020 supervised by [Sayan Bhattacharya](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~u1671158/). I have completed my undergraduate and masters at the University of Oxford, Worcester College in mathematics and computer science.

# Research Interests

My PhD topics are algorithmic game theory and dynamic algorithms. Currently I am mostly interested in dynamic algorithm design, dynamic matching algorithms in particular. I am also pursuing research about streaming algorithms and communication complexity based lower bounds for the streaming model.

# Publications
